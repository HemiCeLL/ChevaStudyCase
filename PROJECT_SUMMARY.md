# 📋 PROJECT SUMMARY - RecipeHub

## ✅ Status: COMPLETE & READY FOR SUBMISSION

# Project summary

Short and to the point: the project is a small static front-end that searches TheMealDB and shows recipes.

What's included
- `index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js` — the app
- Basic docs: `README.md`, `QUICK_START.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `CHECKLIST.md`

Status
- Complete for the assignment. Works as a static site.

How to try
1. Open `index.html`
2. Search for stuff (Pasta, Chicken, etc.)

Notes
- It's simple by design. If you need more features (favorites, caching), they can be added.
