Quick start (very short)

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Type something in the search box, press Enter.
3. Click any recipe card to see more details.

That's basically it.

Some quick tips
- If nothing shows up, try a different keyword (or check your internet).
- Modal closes with Esc, the X button, or clicking outside.
- Use Live Server in VS Code if you want a local server.

Common searches that usually work:
- "Pasta", "Chicken", "Seafood", "Dessert"

If you want to debug
- Open DevTools (F12) and look at the Console and Network tabs.

Troubleshooting
- "No recipes found" → try different spelling or a broader word.
- Loading spinner stuck → refresh the page.
- Video link broken → opens on YouTube directly.

Files of interest
- `index.html` — layout
- `script.js` — where API and UI logic live
- `styles.css` — styling

Future (maybe)
- favorites, caching, PWA
